							<p>Ling Hun is a 2D Platformer Game were Jumping is not affected by gravity (that's what happens when you got your soul stolen). Master the jump to succeed in every level. Enjoy the classic Pixel Art with a mix of Asian ink style in the Background. Change the pace of the game to adapt it to your gamestyle.</p>
							<p>With this idea as a premise, we have a simplistic game but with which we can manage an organic difficulty curve by introducing game mechanics progressively and accentuate the difficulty or regulate it thanks to the level design. So we have a game that can be balanced using two completely separate subjects but at the same time connected to achieve a symbiosis that affects the gameplay and its engagement in a direct and organic way.</p>
							<p>My participation in Ling Hun began from the very conception of the title. As the idea was based on making a portfolio, I wanted something simple but with a little twist, something that would show that with few mechanics you can achieve a good engagement, a good difficulty curve and squeeze the most out of my skills in the game design and level design sections apart from other sections in which I also made my contributions. For example, when creating the SFX and the soundtrack of the game itself. I also created some pixel art assets, had to animate others and designed all the menus, so I also developed the UI/UX with the help of a flowchart to keep things consistent at all times.</p>
							<p>My goal in Ling Hun was to achieve a relaxed experience that could also offer satisfying challenges for practically any type of player, which is why one of the bases of the game is the fact that there are no times, enemies or lives..</p>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="IMG/HEADER-1.png" height="200" width="616" alt="" /></span><h3>How I developed the Concept:</h3>
								<p>When developing the game concept I wanted a simple idea with a very essential feature that the entire gameplay revolved around and that I could add layers of mechanics to add difficulty and engagement to the game loop. So I took something I knew very well, a platform game and gave it a twist on its core mechanics. I also wanted to give the player as little external pressure as possible so they could essentially enjoy the game concept and learn the core mechanics without forcing them to do so. That's why there are no lives, no enemies, and no time to make the player frustrated by something outside of their control, this way you lower the frustration level and get a more "pure" concept of an organic learning or tutorial.</p></p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/gdd-1.png" height="" width="616" alt="" /></span><h3>How I developed the Mechanics:</h3>
								<p>Since the concept is already described we understand that the most key mechanic of the game and the one on which the game loop is based is the jump of Yun who is the main character and who is controlled by the player. In order to make this mechanic something innovative and generate more engagement and/or difficulty, I had to give it a lot of relevance and presence in the game and that is why I decided to give it two variants in order to be able to branch out the possibilities when solving the levels and take the player on a journey where possibilities opened up to offer him a greater sense of control and comfort.
								As seen in the images, Yun's jump is with perpetual momentum at an angle of approximately 45º. This momentum stops when Yun hits a ceiling or wall in the environment where Yun then plummets vertically after having lost said momentum or otherwise when the player uses the jump input again in which case Yun descends with the same momentum and direction but at an angle of around -45º considering that the X axis would be 0º.
								Once the concept was tested in a sandbox and the momentum, angle, speed, fall speed and so on were iterated, the rest of the mechanics around it were conceptualized.</p>
								<p>For that purpose I developed mechanics that complemented the jump but never modified the essence of it, since that could confuse the player and frustrate him, since I understand that changing a concept of jump, something that is deeply rooted in such a basic mechanic for a platform game, is to make the learning process of the same more difficult, since everyone who plays a platform game idealizes that they will play with a gravitational and more or less “common” character jump. That is why it was important not to modify the jump that I conceptualized, but to make it very organic in its learning and a mechanic that was essential at all times.</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="IMG/gdd-2.png" height="" width="616" alt="" /></span>The next feature or mechanic was objects placed in the environment that reset the ability to jump in mid-air, thus continuing to enhance the key concept of the game and following an organic approach, since it was exponentially opening up the possibilities for the player once they had mastered the basic jump.<p>Later on, and gradually, to maintain a difficulty curve, more environment-focused mechanics were added, to make the environment play a more relevant role and make the player aware not only of the possibilities of the main character but also of the environment, and in this organic way the player learns to use both the character's mechanics and the environment and what it can offer to continue advancing. Following this thread of making the environment more relevant, I created a mechanic in which said environment appears and/or disappears when approaching with Yun to unconsciously "force" the concept of taking the environment into account from the player side and give even more relevance to the unique characteristics of Yun's jump.</p>
								<p>Thirdly, I designed a stationary mechanic that gave space to the action in order to give the player a moment to think, iterate their way to solve the level and oxygenate the direct input of the player who may have a tendency to take action without thinking too much, since this type of player will get frustrated more easily if they are not offered a space in an organic way to stop for a moment and think. This mechanic was a set of switches that opened and closed rooms in the level, allowing you to pass through them, thus giving an extra layer of difficulty without, again, touching Yun's main jumping mechanic at all.</p>
								<p>Last but not least, I developed a mechanic that involved both the main character and the environment, thus covering all possibilities and interactions between the two, the character and the environment. This mechanic is a temporary immunity that allows Yun to traverse a certain type of platforms and obstacles in the environment without suffering the consequences of hitting said environment and therefore falling. With this mechanic I manage to generate an added layer of difficulty with which to iterate.</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/LINGHUN3.jpg" height="" width="" alt="" /></span><h3>Facing Challenges:</h3><p>As with all developments, there were problems, difficulties and challenges along the way at all levels, but in this case we will talk about the problems that concern the game design.</p>
								<p>One of the main challenges with this project was the fact of having a very basic and simple idea and keeping it the same throughout the game loop and playthrough of the game. I had to “fight” a lot with myself to avoid overloading the mechanics with difficulty or even making them practically irrelevant to the game loop, but all of that taught me to reduce and simplify concepts, start with the most basic and build and/or modify from the base. It taught me to conceptualize pillars in a much more organic and efficient way, in which you could then always add more layers and/or modify at will if necessary a feature in order to adapt it more or less to both the difficulty and the coherence of the game itself.</p>
								<p>Another challenge, since there were 3 people developing Ling Hun, was the fact that many roles had to be assumed and there was a possibility that the needs of a specific role would not be met because it was conditioned by external factors. In this case, the output of this challenge was the learning of taking into consideration all the parts of the team that make up the development, knowing their tasks, understanding their workloads better, understanding their limitations both in time and in skills and in this way I extended my knowledge beyond my roles not only learning more from my colleagues but from their functions in the face of the same development and it awakened my interest in learning skills beyond my job to be able to facilitate the work of others, to be able to develop in a symbiotic and homogeneous way so that everything I could contribute had a flow between sections of the development that facilitated the connection between them. It also helped me in terms of problem solving since I was the Producer of Ling Hun, having the capacity and ability to understand the work of other roles I understood how to help them solve problems, at least conceptually, to make the development continuous and positive.</p>
								<span class="image right"><img src="IMG/LINGHUN5.jpg" height="" width="" alt="" /></span><h3>Conclusions and final Thoughts:</h3>
								<p>During the development of Ling Hun, which was less than a year, I have learned many things of great value both personally and professionally. I was able to reaffirm my value as a game designer and get rid of the “inner saboteur” so I could focus on a satisfactory development of the concepts I wanted to work with and iterate on. I learned to solve problems during and after development with the right tools and above all to communicate with my colleagues in a way that they could understand the concepts, adapting in each situation to what was most favorable for each particular individual and facilitating concepts through tools and/or verbal or written communication. I also had the opportunity to take the project to the “Indie Dev Day” fair in 2023 and be able to speak with many developers, publishers and all kinds of general public inside and outside the world of video games in a professional way. At this fair I learned to listen to people who had different points of view than me and my way of thinking towards the development of Ling Hun, people within the industry with a lot of experience who were willing to share their knowledge and give me their honest opinion. All of this enriched me on many levels and it was an experience that gave me much more desire to continue improving and keep learning whenever I have the opportunity.</p>

							<h2>Level Design in Ling Hun:</h2>
							<p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
								Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
								Why do we use it?
								It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
